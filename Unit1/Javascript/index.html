  Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Kif might!

  Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!

  Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

  You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? No, I'm Santa Claus! Throw her in the brig. Do a flip! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

  Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Oh yeah, good luck with that. Can we have Bender Burgers again? We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

  Now what? All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Yes! In your face, Gandhi!

  Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
